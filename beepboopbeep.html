        <h1>HTML Basics from a Psych Student</h1>
        <p>Dearest ma'am, <br> &emsp;please believe me that this entire thing took 7 lines of code and should be nowhere near impressive &lt;3</p> 
        
        <p>You don't even need to download HTML, you can just start doing it:</p>
        <p style="color:blueviolet; "><b>Click on F12</b> [granted only on laptop]</p> 
        <p> &emsp;2 panes open, select the element you want to edit in the left one, and then in the right one, you can just add something like "color: blueviolet;" inside element.style{<b>here!</b>} it in your browser</pstyle></p>
